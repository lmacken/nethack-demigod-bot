amulet of change {
  When either worn (unless you have intrinsic unchanging) or eaten, it
  toggles your character's gender between male and female.  Gender has the
  following effects in the game:
      Only female monsters can lay eggs.
      Males are seduced by succubi, females are seduced by incubi.
      Nymphs "seduce" males and "charm" females.
      The Cave(wo)man and Priest(ess) classes have different names.
      It determines how you are addressed (purely cosmetic).
  If you are polymorphed into a single-sex monster, your base gender will
  be altered but not your current one, with the exception that an incubus
  will change into a succubus and vice versa.
    "You are suddenly very feminine/masculine!"
    "You don't feel like yourself." (polymorphed into single-sex monster,
      but character's base sex has changed) 
    "The amulet disintegrates!" (unless intrinsic unchanging)
}
amulet of ESP {
  When worn, you will see monsters that have a brain when they are nearby,
  or anywhere on the level when you are blind.  If eaten, the intrinsic
  telepathy only works when blind. No messages.
}
amulet of life saving {
  When worn, your life will be saved if you die; the amulet then
  disintegrates.  No message when put on. No effect when eaten (nice try).
}
amulet of magical breathing{
  When either worn or eaten, you gain amphibiousness and unbreathing.  You
  can swim under water and cannot be strangled or choked.  No messages.
}
amulet of reflection {
  When worn, rays from wands, spells, and breath attacks can be
  reflected.  No message when put on.  No effect when eaten (nice try).
}
amulet of restful sleep {
  When worn or eaten, you will fall asleep within 1 to 100 turns. You awaken
  within 1 to 20 turns or when disturbed.  If you continue wearing an
  amulet of restful sleep, the cycle will repeat.  No message.
}
amulet of strangulation {
  When worn, you are strangled to death in 6 turns.  When eaten, you
  instantly choke, with 1/20 chance of survival.  Exceptions are made
  if you have unbreathing from an amulet of magical breathing or
  polyself.
    "It constricts your throat!"
}
amulet of unchanging {
  When either worn or eaten, you are prevented from changing your current
  form by polymorph or other means, and are also protected from being
  slimed; any sliming in progress is halted. No messages.
}
amulet versus poison {
  When either worn or eaten, you gain poison resistance.  No message.
}
cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor {
  No effect or message when put on.  Cannot be eaten.
}
Amulet of Yendor {
  When carried, you get all of the following (mostly bad):
    You get clairvoyance, if it is not blocked.
    When casting spells, your energy is drained.
    Hunger is increased (additional to normal amulet hunger).
    Your luck timeout is increased.
    Monster difficulty will depend on your deepest level reached, not
    your current dungeon level.
    Monsters are less likely to be generated asleep.
    When going up levels in Gehennom, you may teleport down 0 to 3
    levels instead.  The chance depends on your alignment:
        UP    L      N      C
        +1  75.0%  75.0%  75.0%
         0   6.25   8.33  12.5
        -1   6.25   8.33  12.5
        -2   6.25   8.33   0.0
        -3   6.25   0.0    0.0
    You cannot level teleport.
    Teleportation within the level is blocked 1/3 of the time.
    The Wizard can teleport or level teleport to find you.
    The Wizard will try to steal the Amulet.
    You are permitted to enter the Plane of Earth by taking the upstairs,
    or quaffing a cursed potion of gain level, from dungeon level 1.
    You can activate the endgame portals.
  When worn or wielded, you get messages about the amulet getting
  "hotter" as you approach magic portals.  No message when putting
  on.  Cannot be eaten.  (Would you sacrifice yourself, then?)

rock {
  Rocks are immediately identified on examination, and pose little
  difficulty or challenge to the adventurer. They make a cheap and usually
  plentiful source of ammunition, should you lack or wish to conserve other
  ranged attacks. ("Good ol' rock. Nothing beats that." -- Bart Simpson)
}
touchstone {
  Touchstones are most readily distinguished by their effect when rubbed
  with something hard, such as an iron weapon; they will make a "scritch,
  scritch" sound. Their primary use is rubbing them with other gems and
  stones; if blessed (or also if uncursed, for Archeologists and gnomes),
  the object rubbed with will be identified. Rubbing a touchstone of any
  b/u/c status with rings or gold, or non-touchstone gray stones with
  other types of object, may produce coloured streaks or scratches; but
  will not provide any further useful information.
  Note that being rubbed on a cursed touchstone may shatter gems or rocks
  (but not other gray stones).
}
luckstone {
  Luckstones can be identified by their effect (see "Luck" below) with the
  help of enlightenment, by their valuation by shopkeepers, or by the
  presence of the guaranteed luckstone at the top of a gems cache in the
  Gnome King's Wine Cellar version of the bottom level of the Gnomish Mines.
  (Or, indeed, by the Heart of Ahriman being one).
}
loadstone (The Jeremey DeCausemaker Stone) {
  As noted above, loadstones are almost always generated cursed; furthermore,
  they autocurse on being dropped or otherwise leaving the main inventory,
  and a cursed loadstone cannot be let go of. It is therefore best to
  identify them while they lie on the ground; kicking them will usually
  elicit a "Thump!" rather than movement across the floor, but being
  extremely strong (at least 22 strength; 18/** is not sufficient) while
  wearing kicking boots or being a Samurai or Monk may allow some movement
  (watch how far it goes).
}
flint stone {
  These exist primarily to make it hard to identify touchstones, loadstones
  and luckstones, and are best identified by elimination of the other three.
  They have few special properties, but do inflict somewhat more damage than
  other stones or gems when used as sling ammunition.
